This blog is going to act as a tool for documenting all my projects! I use markdown to write all the notes and documentation on my computer so I figured why not make some of it publicly available! It's such an easy way to serve readable webpages.

The dating format for text files on markdown is a little different than the one I use in my filesystem but I should be able to write a shellscript to easily modify it. Let's test out different kinds of formatting...

#### Enumerations!

1.  Number one.
2.  Number two.
3.  Number three.
4.  Number five.

Did you notice? Good job!

#### Bullet-point Lists!

*   Bullet point number *
+   Bullet point number +
-   Bullet point number -
    *   Sub-bullet point.

`Here's what a code snippet would look like`

    This should do the same thing...

Well, I guess not...

Tis, for sure.

### It's astounding how quickly and easily I'm modifying this webpage...

I think that's enough for now. Cheers!
