title: Site Goals (Part-0)
---

### I'm going to start writing out my goals and ideas for this website, On this website.

#### Things I want to do with this website:

*   Create a shell script that converts the titles of my dailyNotes files to the yyyy-mm-dd-title.md format.
*   Figure out if Github Pages is definitely the way to go or if I like some other markdown-based website creation tool better.
*   Figure out how to create other tabs on the homepage.
*   Figure out how to get SSL encryption.
*   Have "Nikos' state-of-the-art" sections where I explain all my capabilities and shortcomings in any domain like engineering or German or rock climbing. I love documenting my progress. It's very psychologically helpful.
*   Find out if I want to keep this blog or move to Medium or Wordpress or something else. Figure out how to embed a soundcloud podcast carousel somewhere on the website.
*   Have a "what I Learned Today" section.
