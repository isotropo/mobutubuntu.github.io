## Neonite Clock Design

Media Assets to show:
- Renders:
    - Renders of the LED PCB
    - Renders of the full assembly
    - Render of the dial
- Videos of the section cutaway thing
- Picture of a miniature print, possibly mounted, fitted with LED strip
- Small Neonite Clock logo


Components:
- LED PCB
- Clock motor
- Shell
- Window
- Clock hands
- Power supply
- Code


## Design Principles:

Inspired by Jay Simmons and his love for Norman Bel Geddes. Mesmerizing and evokes feeling of intelligent design

Principles:
- Inspiring
- Proportionally correct
- Mesmerizing
- Clean
- Realized, delivered.


## LED PCB

The design process:


The LED PCB was split into six pieces (60 degrees each). WS2812Bs were used. Also known as Neopixels. Neopixels are individually addressable.

Designed in Fusion 360, which allows for cool version control/pingpong features for working between Fusion and Eagle.


## Clock Motor:
- Dimensions, how it's mounted, why the specific clock motor was chosen, etc


## Shell:

Client wanted a more sleek, modern rendition


## Window:

- Laser cut acrylic or polycarbonate


## Clock Hands:
- Show ones I chose, show other potential suppliers.


## Power supply:
Talk about how to calculate power needs of a system.

Explain wiring.


## Code:

- Used Arduino on an Uno, could use for example an ESP32.

- Explain marquee animation

- Could talk about how WLED could be used
