## Beckman Coulter Medical Automation

Beckman Couler is, in my opinion, one of the most interesting biotech-automation companies in existence. They [label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beckman_Coulter) themselves as a company that makes "biomedical laboratory instruments". The company was founded by Caltech professor [Arnold O. Beckman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Orville_Beckman) in ~1934.
