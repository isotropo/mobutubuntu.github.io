This is an old project but I've never posted on a blog post about it before, just a quick mention on Snapchat in 2017 or so.

The post is under construction. Photos coming soon!

Full disclosure, my design is 100% inspired by the incredible [Spectrum Dock Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7ZwQa8vYnY) by [DIY Perks](https://www.youtube.com/@DIYPerks)! Apparently his last name is [literally Perks](https://diyperks.com/about/). 

Nonetheless, it was great practice for me, and I do have some thoughts about how it could be improved that I might implement at some point, for practice and maybe also for my portfolio if nothing else.

I created my version of the design with a drawing I made based on (99% sure) the contour of the Sennheiser HD280 Pros. A creator, and incidentally amazing person, named [David Shorey](https://www.shoreydesigns.com/bio) helped me design it in Fusion 360 when I was a Fusion 360 noob! He's quite innovative in [this space](https://www.shoreydesigns.com/3d-printing-on-fabric/wsetec1sinxazi972ycpsrjssxv9p3) among many others! He cofounded a project called [Davant Systems](https://www.davantsystems.com) (software still in beta as of this writing) that I highly recommend you check out! He also inspired me to go to SIGGRAPH for the first time this year, where I met quite a few interesting people! Both at the event and at a SIGGRAPH afterparty at an up-and-coming space in DTLA called [Future Factory](https://www.futurefactory.xyz) (we want you to succeed so bad)!

## The Design:

`show images/videos of the design`

`show the version made of walnut`

`show the version made with MDF/Acrylic`

This version used lasercut sheets of MDF and Acrylic, lasercut at HexLab Makerspace!

I connected an WS2812B LED strip to an Arduino and a friend helped me map the voltage range from two potentiometers to 0 -> 255, and this range was then mapped to Hue and Luminance so I could sweep through the color spectrum and vary the brigtness!
