#### General Topics:
*   Augmented Reality
    -   Guy at Nullspace Labs is working on an AR/VR web-shopping application.
*   AI
    -   My Cousin just finished a paper on rotational equivariance for machine learning. I could do a summary of it or sections of it (at a time) as a weekly post.
*   Virtual Reality
    -   There's this really fun game on the HTC Vive that I could do a short writeup on for fun lol.
*   Robotics
    -   I think it would be cool to do research reports on different robotics companies like Sarcos Robotics, Boston Dynamics, etc.
    -   I could also cover more mechatronics-oriented companies like Beckman Coulter.
*   Quantum computing
    -   I know literally nothing about quantum computing but I could just link to interesting news articles I found.
*   Advanced Robotics
    -   There's an idea someone at HexLab had that I would love to sort of... Flesh out. A sort of closed-loop PCB manufacturing/testing AI-device.
*   Cryptocurrency
    -   Once I get a little farther along in my math I'll probably do more on cryptocurrency. I'd love to be able to do technical whitepaper analyses.
    -   Can talk about different corners of the crypto world like FileCoin and Steemit.
*   Blogging/Social Media
    -   I'm a huge nerd and I love custom meta-tools. I'd love to write about ways that you could easily publish writeups to multiple websites/social media platforms in an automated fashion from a low-level tool or a terminal application.
